# a full-stack, multi-platform ticketing and processing app

For the past month, I have been working with a small team to develop a website where you can purchase tickets for an event, and a scanning application for event staff that connects to the ticket database.
We used MongoDB as a database, React + Vite with TailwindCSS for our front-end, and Next.js with Mongoose for our backend data processing.
My job was primarily to structure and develop the scanning application as well as structure and style components of the front-end.

I ran into several issues with the scanning app.
